    "1": "<b>Heey!</b> Have you ever thought of how magnets can help the <color=#c8d45d>environment</color>,generating <color=#ffc2a1>less polution</color> and helping with traffic?",
    "2": "Humans are in a constant seek for <color=#c8d45d><b>renewable and clean energy</b></color> to power up our lives and mantain a sustainable world for upcoming generations",
    "3": "This is a <color=#ff5277><b>Maglev</b></color>. It's like a train, but it only requires <color=#ffcd1f><b>magnetic and electric force</b></color> to run, reducing the amount of cars on the streets and improving air quality.",
    "4": "Let me show how all those magnets and electricity works, so we can build more <color=#c8d45d><b>environment-friendly</b></color> transportation around the world.",
    "5": "Firstly,how does a Magnet work?",
    "6": "Magnets are objects that are surrounded by a <color=#ff8933>magnetic field</color>,being able to <color=#92e8c0>magnetize certain materials</color>,such as iron and steel and repel and attract other magnets",
    "7": "That attraction and repulsion between two magnets is called <color=#ff5277><b>Magnetic Force</b></color>, which doesn't require contact to be applied",
    "8": "All the magnetized objects have a <color=#4fa4b8><b>SOUTH</b></color> and a <color=#ad2f45><b>NORTH</b></color> pole, when you approach 2 magnets by the <color=#ff8933><b>same pole,they repel</b></color>. They <color=#ff8933><b>attract each other when the poles are opposite!</b></color>",
    "9": "I have a <color=#ff8933><b>magnet tool</b></color> with me! You can press <color=#ff8933><b>Z</b></color> to turn it on and off and <color=#ff8933><b>X</b></color> to change poles",
    "10": "You can also hold down the <color=#ff8933><b>↑</b></color> and <color=#ff8933><b>↓</b></color> keys to rotate the pole by 90º degrees! The <sprite index=0> above my head will mark the direction",
    "11": "<b>Be aware:</b> Everytime the tool is activated or has its polarity changed, you use <color=#ff8933>1 energy</color>. Manage it safely and let's get past this maze",
    "12": "You'll need to activate the lever to open the door and get the box",
    "13": "Press <b><color=#ff8933>C</color></b> to interact with other objects!",
    "14": "You're doing great!!! Let's get to the next level",
    "15": "I got a new challenge for you! This level is a bit more complicated",
    "16": "<b>The bigger magnets are stronger than the smaller ones</b>, so you may use them to reach far places. The <color=#ff8933>magnetic force </color> gets weaker as it gets far, so maybe you'll need a little hop",
    "17": "Reminder: When magnetizing an object,the polarity will be the <b><color=#e64539>opposite</color></b> of the affected magnetic field",
    "18": "<color=#ff8933><b>A quick tip: </b></color>If you <b>switch</b> my tool's polarity while holding a magnetized box,it will be thrown away by the magnetic force",
    "19": "In my lab, you're only allowed to magnetize one box at a time,so the puzzle gets harder!",
    "20": "Now let's introduce a bit of <color=#ff8933><b>electric force!</b></color> Have you ever heard of static electricity?",
    "21": "Electric force, like magnetic force, is a non contact energy. It cames from the free move of electrons on a material",
