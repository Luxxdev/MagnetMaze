    "completedText": "Congratulations for progressing through the Lab!! Now you know how magnets work!!",
    "1": "<b>Heey!</b> Have you ever thought of how magnets can help the <color=#c8d45d>environment</color>,generating <color=#ffc2a1>less polution</color> and helping with traffic?",
    "2": "We are in a constant seek for <color=#c8d45d><b>renewable and clean energy</b></color> to power up our lives and mantain a sustainable world for upcoming generations.",
    "3": "This is a <color=#ff5277><b>Maglev</b></color>. It's like a train, but it only requires <color=#ffcd1f><b>magnetic and electric force</b></color> to run, reducing the amount of cars on the streets and improving air quality.",
    "4": "Let me show how all those magnets and electricity works, so we can build more <color=#c8d45d><b>environment-friendly</b></color> transportation around the world.",
    "5": "Firstly,how does a Magnet work?",
    "6": "Magnets are objects that are surrounded by a <color=#ff8933>magnetic field</color>,being able to <color=#92e8c0>magnetize certain materials</color>,such as iron and steel, which repel and attract other magnets",
    "7": "That attraction and repulsion between two magnets is called <color=#ff5277><b>Magnetic Force</b></color>, which doesn't require contact to be applied",
    "8": "All the magnetized objects have a <color=#4fa4b8><b>SOUTH</b></color> and a <color=#ad2f45><b>NORTH</b></color> pole, when you approach 2 magnets by the <color=#ff8933><b>same pole,they repel</b></color>. They <color=#ff8933><b>attract each other when the poles are opposite!</b></color>",
    "9": "I have a <color=#ff8933><b>magnetic tool</b></color> with me! You can press <color=#ff8933><b>Z</b></color> to turn it on and off and <color=#ff8933><b>X</b></color> to change poles.",
    "10": "You can also hold down the <color=#ff8933><b>↑</b></color> and <color=#ff8933><b>↓</b></color> keys to rotate the pole upwards and downwards! The <sprite index=0> above my head will mark the direction",
    "11": "<b>Beware:</b> Using my tool consumes <color=#ff8933>energy</color>. Right now I need some <color=#ECC81F>batteries</color> to recharge it. Keep an eye out not to run out of energy.",
    "12": "There are objects which you can interact with.",
    "13": "Press <b><color=#ff8933>C</color></b> to interact with them!",
    "14": "You're doing great!!! Let's get to the next level",
    "15": "I got a new challenge for you! This level is a bit more complicated",
    "16": "<b>The bigger magnets are stronger than the smaller ones</b>, so you may use them to reach far places. The <color=#ff8933>magnetic force </color> gets weaker as it gets far, so maybe you'll need a little hop",
    "17": "Reminder: When magnetizing an object,the polarity will be the <b><color=#e64539>opposite</color></b> of the affected magnetic field",
    "18": "<color=#ff8933><b>A quick tip: </b></color>If you <b>switch</b> my tool's polarity while holding a magnetized box,it will be thrown away by the magnetic force",
    "19": "In my lab, you're only allowed to magnetize one box at a time,so the puzzle gets harder!",
    "20": "Now let's introduce a bit of <color=#ff8933><b>electric force!</b></color> Do you know why electricity exists?",
    "21": "Electric force, like magnetic force, is a non contact energy. It cames from the electrons on a material, and they can flow through materials",
    "22": "Some materials can conduct more electricity than others, it depends on how the electrons are displaced on that material. We can also make those electrons move.",
    "23": "By friction, we can make some materials lose and gain electrons, generating static electricity! Try rubbing your feet on the carpet ahead!",
    "24": "Objects with opposite charges will attract each other, so they can exchange electrons and neutralize their charge",
    "25": "In some cases, you might feel the electric discharge. Running with hands on metal handrails in a really dry place, for instance.",
    "26": "And how magnet force and electricity comes together?",
    "27": "One way both of them interact is in electromagnets. You've already seen some in the previous stages, like my tool, that requires electricity to create the magnet field",
    "28": "And all the magnets on the walls, ground and ceilings are also electromagnets! The more electricity they get, the stronger they become",
    "29": "Fill the batteries attached to the magnet to increase the magnetic force",
    "30": "Another way to generate electricity is through magnetic fields in motion! When a magnetized object moves next to a conducting material, it causes the energy to flow through that material",
    "31": "Run through that coil and fill the battery",
    "32": "As you remember, electric energy flows on conducting materials. This flow is called electric current",
    "33": "The boxes you magnetize can get electrically charged! Take them to the plugs to procceed in this maze!",
    "34": "Beware: The dark static boxes ahead are made of a non-conductive material!",
    "35": "Now it's time to throw it all together! Do you think you can do it?",
    "F0": "Don't forget to change your tool's polarity to interact with the magnetic field",
    "F1": "The closer the objects are, the stronger the magnetic force becomes! Throw the boxes and reach higher with it!",
    "F2": "When charged, move quick to lose less static energy! Move the boxes wisely.",
    "F3": "Charge all that is needed to power the magnets and reach the goals",
    "F4": "Remember all the stuff you've passed, the electricity, magnetism and revise all of that in this stage's puzzle."
