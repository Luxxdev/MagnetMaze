    "completedText1": "<b >Congratulations for progressing through the Lab</b>!! Bet you loved all those puzzles! If you want one more challenge, why don't you try my special bonus level?",
    "completedText2": "<b >Incredible!! If you overcame even that one, you're truly a magnet master. Congratulations!!",
    "1": "<b >Heey!</b> Have you ever thought of how magnets can help the <color=#c8d45d>environment</color>, by generating <color=#ffc2a1>less polution</color> and helping with traffic?",
    "2": "We are in a constant seek for <color=#c8d45d><b >renewable and clean energy</b></color> to power up our lives and mantain a sustainable world for upcoming generations.",
    "3": "This is a <color=#ff5277><b >Maglev</b></color>. It's like a train, but it only requires <color=#ffcd1f><b >magnetic and electric force</b></color> to run, reducing the amount of cars on the streets and improving air quality.",
    "4": "Let me show how all those magnets and electricity work, so we can build more <color=#c8d45d><b >environment-friendly</b></color> transportation around the world.",
    "5": "Okay, I just interacted with that <color=#e64539><b >magnet up there</b></color>. Did you see the <color=#e64539><b >wire glowing up</b></color>? It means that this button has activated it. These wires will be helpful guiding us, but first things first. Do you know how magnets work?",
    "6": "Magnets are objects that are surrounded by a <color=#ff8933>magnetic field</color>, being able to <color=#92e8c0>magnetize certain materials</color>, such as iron and steel, which repel and attract other magnets.",
    "7": "That attraction and repulsion between two magnets is called <color=#ff5277><b >Magnetic Force</b></color>, which is applied from a distance.",
    "8": "All the magnetized objects have a <color=#4fa4b8><b >SOUTH</b></color> and a <color=#e64539><b >NORTH</b></color> pole. When you approach 2 magnets with the <color=#ff8933><b >same pole, they repel</b></color>. They <color=#ff8933><b >attract each other when the poles are opposite!</b></color>.",
    "9": "I have a <color=#ff8933><b >magnetic tool</b></color> with me! You can press <color=#ff8933><b >Z</b></color> to turn it on and off and <color=#ff8933><b >X</b></color> to change poles.",
    "10": "You can also hold down the <color=#ff8933><b >up(↑)</b></color> and <color=#ff8933><b >down(↓)</b></color> keys to rotate the pole upwards and downwards! The magnet icon above my head will mark the direction.",
    "11": "Keep an eye out for the <color=#ff5277>balloons</color> to raise your score. It won't give you any advantage, but it'll definitely give you bragging rights among your friends.",
    "12": "There are objects which you can interact with.",
    "13": "Press <b ><color=#ff8933>C</color></b> to interact with them!",
    "14": "Also, keep in mind that if you ever have doubts and wish to re-read one of the previous important dialogs all you have to do is click that dialog button on the top right of the screen.",
    "15": "I got a new challenge for you! This level is a bit more complicated.",
    "16": "<b >The bigger magnets are stronger than the smaller ones</b>, so you may use them to reach far places. The <color=#ff8933>magnetic force </color> gets weaker as it gets far, so maybe you'll need a little hop.",
    "17": "Now let's introduce a bit of <color=#ff8933><b >electric force!</b></color> Do you know why electricity exists?",
    "18": "Electric force, like magnetic force, is a <color=#ff8933><b >non contact energy</b></color>. It comes from the <color=#92e8c0><b >electrons</b></color> on a material, and they can flow through materials.",
    "19": "Some materials can conduct <color=#ff8933><b >more electricity than others</b></color>, it depends on how the <color=#92e8c0><b >electrons</b></color> are displaced on that material. We can also make those electrons move.",
    "20": "By <color=#c8d45d>friction</color>, we can make some materials <color=#e64539><b >lose or gain electrons</b></color>, generating static electricity! Try rubbing your feet on the carpet ahead!",
    "21": "Objects with <color=#e64539><b >opposite</b></color> charges will attract each other, so they can <color=#ff8933><b >exchange electrons and neutralize their charge</b></color>.",
    "22": "In some cases, you might feel the <color=#92e8c0><b >electric discharge</b></color>. Running with hands on metal handrails in a really dry place, for instance.",
    "23": "In my lab, you're only allowed to magnetize one box at a time, so the puzzle gets harder!",
    "24": "And how magnetic force and electricity comes together?",
    "25": "One way both of them interact is in <color=#ff8933><b >electromagnets</b></color>. You've already seen some in the previous stages, like my tool, that requires electricity to create the magnetic field ...",
    "26": "...All the magnets on the walls, ground and ceilings are also electromagnets! <color=#ff8933><b >With more electricity, they become more powerful. </b></color>",
    "27": "Fill the <color=#c8d45d><b >batteries attached</b></color> to the magnet to increase their <color=#ff8933><b >magnetic force</b></color>. The higher the amount of batteries connected to an electromagnet, the greater the strength of the magnetic force produced.",
    "28": "Another way to generate electricity is through <color=#ff8933><b >magnetic fields in motion</b></color>! When a magnetized object moves next to a conducting material, it causes the energy to <color=#ff8933><b >flow through that material</b></color>. That <color=#ff8933><b >coil</b></color> is a great example!",
    "29": "If a magnetized object moves next to it, an electric current will be generated. As a matter of fact, with a higher amount of turns on a <color=#ff8933><b >coil</b></color>, more electricity will be generated.",
    "30": "Run through that <color=#ff8933><b >coil</b></color> and fill the <color=#63ab3f><b >battery</b></color>.",
    "31": "As you remember, electric energy <color=#ff8933><b >flows on conducting materials</b></color>. This flow is called <color=#ff8933><b >electric current</b></color>.",
    "32": "The boxes you magnetize can get <color=#ff8933><b >electrically charged!</b></color> Take them to the plugs to proceed in this maze!",
    "33": "<b >Beware:</b> The dark static boxes ahead are made of a <color=#1b1f21><b >non-conductive material!</b></color>",
    "34": "Now it's time to throw it all together! Do you think you can do it?",
    "35": "<color=#ff8933><b >Remember: </b></color>If you <b >switch</b> my tool's polarity while holding a magnetized box, it will be thrown away by the magnetic force.",
    "36": "Also, if you ever drop a box and you need to bring it back up, remember that it can also be magnetized vertically, by interacting with the box while holding <color=#ff8933><b >up(↑)</b></color> and <color=#ff8933><b >down(↓)</b></color>.",
    "F0": "Don't forget to change your tool's <color=#ad2f45><b >polarity</b></color> to interact with the magnetic field.",
    "F1": "The closer the objects are, the stronger the <color=#f0b541><b >magnetic force</b></color> becomes! Throw the boxes and reach higher with it!",
    "F2": "When charged, move quickly to lose less static energy! Move the boxes wisely.",
    "F3": "Charge all that is needed to <color=#ff8933><b >power the magnets</b></color> and reach the goals.",
    "F4": "Remember all the stuff you've passed, the electricity, magnetism and revise all of that in this stage's puzzle.",
    "100": "Use arrows to move around and Spacebar to jump.",
    "101": "Press <color=#ff8933><b >Z</b></color> to turn my tool on and off. Remember it uses energy when turned on and continues using while it stays on.",
    "102": "Press <color=#ff8933><b >X</b></color> to invert the pole's direction, but be careful, since it also uses energy. And keep in mind you can hold the <color=#ff8933><b >up(↑)</b></color> and <color=#ff8933><b >down(↓)</b></color> keys to rotate the magnetic field upwards and downwards.",
    "103": "Press <b ><color=#ff8933>C</color></b> to interact with objects, like levers and boxes. When interacting with boxes you use energy to magnetize them. Keep in mind that boxes can also be magnetized vertically by using the <color=#ff8933><b >up(↑)</b></color> and <color=#ff8933><b >down(↓)</b></color> keys.",
